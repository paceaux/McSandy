Version:
   1
	.01 :: initial upload
	.02 :: added some interactive CSS for hovers of buttons, a touch o' shadows
	.03 :: Storing CSS and JS
	       Converting CSS and JS to strings so the actual result works
	       Removed the incompleted indexedDB script
	.04 :: changed the content variable to an array. 
	       Using JSON.stringify and JSON.parse to and from storage
	       minified the CSS
	.05 :: FireFox Support finally. Using an if-then to detect the browser specific extensions
		   detecting whether user has internet connection, showing that in upper right
		   Added a title to the editing section and the iframe section
		   HTML section displays upon page load
		   first item stored in local storage loads upon page load
		   Brightened the color of the nav 
		   color for :hover and :focus of buttons
		   changed widths and displays of the sections so that switching from HTML->js doesn't cause page skipping
		   added TABINDEX to the HTML->JS switchers and tabs

Upcoming:
	refresh iframe on a timed blur - but not submit to localstorage until hitting save
	add some custom shortcuts
	automatically take user back to HTML when changing saved item
	after hitting "save", the 'saved' button only shows 'saved' for a few seconds

Known Defects:
	required doubleclick to switch frm one type of code to the next
	"save" doesn't seem to fully refresh the iframe
