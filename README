	.01 :: initial upload
	.02 :: added some interactive CSS for hovers of buttons, a touch o' shadows
	.03 :: Storing CSS and JS
	       Converting CSS and JS to strings so the actual result works

	       minified the CSS
	.05 :: FireFox Support finally. Using an if-then to detect the browser specific extensions
		   detecting whether user has internet connection, showing that in upper right
		   Added a title to the editing section and the iframe section
		   HTML section displays upon page load
		   first item stored in local storage loads upon page load
		   Brightened the color of the nav 
		   color for :hover and :focus of buttons
		   changed widths and displays of the sections so that switching from HTML->js doesn't cause page skipping

Upcoming:
	add some custom shortcuts
	automatically take user back to HTML when changing saved item
	after hitting "save", the 'saved' button only shows 'saved' for a few seconds
	Export to file features (probably a 2.0 version)

Known Defects:
	required doubleclick to switch frm one type of code to the next
